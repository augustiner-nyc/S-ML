# SUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING
Overview of Supervised Machine Learning Code in R I have built.

How to use it:
For most Data partitions you only need to plug in a Data Source (1) and replace X (2).

1. Decision Tree Modeling
2. Random Forest Modeling
3. Support Vector Machines Modeling
4. Linear and Logistic Regression
5. Naive-Bayes Modeling
6. Project built to trade Intraday Index Futures (ES) using 1-minute Data (in the works)
